A repository of Corona SDK-related stuff

Here you'll find some of my Corona SDK-related work including games I've released (which may currently be available in Google Play and the iOS app store) and which I now consider open-source.

* **battlecade** - a game that offers the player a bunch of mini-games to play (it originally had a network component so that you could play against other people, and you'll find that code here, but it's deactivated - this game is available in the Google Play Store for free)
  
* **engineer** - a puzzle game where you play the part of a starship engineer and you have to divert particles into energy ports or the ship explodes (this game is available in the Google Play Store for free)
