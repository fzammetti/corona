A repository of Corona SDK-related stuff

Here you'll find some of my Corona SDK-related work including games I've released (which may currently be available in Google Play and the iOS app store) and which I now consider open-source.

In terms of license, you can pretty much do what you want with t his, just don't claim anything as your own and it's cool with me.
