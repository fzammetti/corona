Due to license restrictions, this source code does NOT include:

text_candy.lua

This is the Text Candy library X-pressive.  If you want to
actually build this, you'll need to get a license for that library here:
http://www.x-pressive.com

Also note that Battlecade was originally meant to be an online game, but due
to it being an absolute failure in terms of sales, I removed the online
component and that's the only version available in any mobile store now.
However, I simply disabled the menu items related to online play and the code
behind it remains.  Well, except for the server part.
